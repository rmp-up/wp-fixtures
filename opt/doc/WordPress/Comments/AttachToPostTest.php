/**
 * Attach comment to post
 *
 * Usually a comment is made for a post.
 * To attach a comment to a post you can use the post_id field:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * WP_Post:
 *   commented_post_here:
 *     post_title: Rotating
 *
 * WP_Comment:
 *   very_first_comment:
 *     post_ID: "@commented_post_here"
 * ```
 *
 * This will link the WP_Post to the comment.
 * So the post_id now holds the complete WP_Post object.
 * After persisting it turns into the post_id.
