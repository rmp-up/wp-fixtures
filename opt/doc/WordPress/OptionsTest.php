/**
 * Options
 *
 * Plenty things are stored in options like what the site-url is,
 * which plugin is active, all the rewrite rules and many more things.
 * When setting up a blog (for testing / CI) we may want to have some options
 * in a particular state like this:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * options:
 *   default_options:
 *     active_plugins:
 *       - akismet/akismet.php
 *       - hello.php
 *       - woocommerce/woocommerce.php
 *     blogname: Yet another shop
 *     template: twentynineteen
 *     stylesheet: twentynineteen
 *     ping_sites: ''
 * ```
 *
 * With this the active plugins would be set to have Akismet,
 * Hello Dolly and WooCommerce activated.
 * Also the blogname would be changed,
 * the active theme set
 * and the ability to ping sites removed.
 * Any option can be changed that way.
